# Advent of Code 2021

[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) !
I’m trying Rust this year, let’s see how it goes :)

For reference, I only know Python and I have absolutely no experience with typed languages nor with compiled languages.

# What I learned

- Day 1: Use of `cargo`, a rust project’s structure, the `cargo.toml` file and the `[[bin]]` keyword
- Day 2: The difference between a `String` and a `str`, the `option` type and the `unwrap()` method, a first try at simple pattern matching and string splitting with `lines()` and `split_whitespace()` methods.
